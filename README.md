voorspel
========

The source code for the Meteor based sequence of puzzles we designed to slowly reveal internally at Q42 where our annual holiday will be taking place.

To get it to run, install Meteor:

    curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh
    
And Meteorite:

    npm install -g meteorite
    
Then run the site from its folder using meteorite:

    mrt
    
Open a browser to `http://localhost:3000` and you're good to go!
